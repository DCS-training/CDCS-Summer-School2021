# Data Wrangling with Python 
In this workshop, we will cover the basics of data wrangling. We will begin by understanding what "data" is, how to think about it in a way that is mindful of its origin and its subsequent use, in order to be aware of what "data" can and cannot say. We will learn what libraries are, how to import them, how to read files and work on them using pandas dataframe, one of the most powerful and used tools for data analysis in python. Given that it is an introductory session we will also emphasise or review basic notions such as assignments, variables, properties, and methods. These basic notions and skills will be assumed in the following workshops.

## Topics
* Understanding what "data" and data "wrangling" are
* Importing libraries, reading files, and pandas dataframes
* Writing python: assignments, variables, properties, and methods
* On "types": python types and pandas types
* Exploring the data: basic information
* Working with missing data: errors, omissions, variations
* Data types: the right type for the job
* Comparing data: finding a standard
* Data Binning: grouping to get a feel of the data
* Dummy variables: from categories to numbers
