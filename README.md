# CDCS-Summer-School

Welcome to the **CDCS Data and Text analysis Summer School Repo**.
Here you will be able to access all the material, data, and instructions connected to the school.

## Content of the Repository
Each block has its own folder and within each folder you can find a read me file, a data file/folder, and the code that will be used during the class.

In the **Readme** file you will also find instructions on **packages** you may need to have installed before the start of the block. 
If you never install a package before do not worry we are going to cover how to do it during the first day (Data Wrangling).

To facilitate the download of the material we also created ***Zipped File*** folder where you can find the blocks folders already zipped and ready to be downloaded.
Please **before** the module/s you are signed up for take place, download, unzip, and read the readme file of the block. 

If you do not have R and/or Python already installed in your machine check the **Installation Instructions** file.
Here you can find detailed instructions on how to install both programme. 
Please make sure to have the software needed install before the start of the Summer School.
PLease note that we are not going to cover the installation during the classes.
If you have any issue with the software installation email us at cdcs@ed.ac.uk.
Additionally, we are offering an installation troubleshoot meeting on **Friday 04th of June**.

## Summer School Code of Cunduct

o    The summer school is meant to be interactive, and you will be prompted to replicate what the instructor is demonstrating on your own machine. 

o    Besides the instructors, there will be helpers present in the call who are there to help you if you get stuck or if you run into an error. Please be vocal about problems in the chat and someone will help you with addressing it. You may be asked to move to a breakout room if needed. During the introduction at the start of each block, we are going to cover how to ask for help in more detail. 

o    If you have a question, you can use the raise hand feature and we will notify the instructor. When you are not speaking, please mute yourself to avoid background noise. 

o    The instructors will ask questions that you can reply to either via chat or using the non-verbal indicators. We are going to show you where the non-verbal indicators are in the introduction, but you can find them clicking on the “Participants” tab, the same tab where the raise hand feature is.  

o    We promote an inclusive and welcoming environment, so we ask you to be respectful towards our instructors, helpers and fellow participants. Disruptive behavior will not be tolerated, and you will be asked to leave if it occurs.
