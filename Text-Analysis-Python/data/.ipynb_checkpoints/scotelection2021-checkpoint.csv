If her chief of staff knew then, and was interfering in the investigation, it blows another enormous hole in the First Minister’s story. “If civil servants said the First Minister’s chief of staff was interfering in the investigation in a ‘very bad’ way, then that is a sacking offence. It raises serious questions about how she tried to interfere, how she found out, who told her, when she knew, and who she went on to tell. “It further raises the question if anyone told Nicola Sturgeon that her chief of staff was interfering in the investigation. If they did, a number of lies have been told to the Scottish Parliament. If they didn’t, it still makes Nicola Sturgeon’s story of when she claims to have found out about complaints even more implausible. “These are all ‘ifs’.

Read our full statement from Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross here 👇 “Any time John Swinney is in trouble, the Greens set aside all principles and ride to his rescue. “The Greens have shown again that they will let the SNP away with anything, even ignoring votes of the Scottish Parliament. “Their cause always comes first – and that’s independence, not the environment. Their true colours are not green, they are SNP yellow. “The case for the Vote of No Confidence in John Swinney is clear to any impartial observer. We can no longer trust him to do the right thing. He has abused his power to cover up crucial evidence. “He said he would respect two votes of the Scottish Parliament – he didn’t. He ignored them entirely until his job was on the line. Even now, he is still hiding evidence from around 10 legal consultations. “He claimed he had released all key legal advice – only to wait a few days and release more. He blatantly withheld crucial evidence until after Nicola Sturgeon’s evidence session. “We are supposed to accept that no notes were taken at a pivotal meeting involving the First Minister, senior lawyers and the permanent secretary. That is ludicrous and beyond belief for any fair-minded person.”",798,523,178,"https://www.facebook.com/136308776480/posts/10157807947491481"

This is another crushing blow to her chances of surviving this scandal. We won't stop holding her to account. Full statement from Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross “These are some of the devastating documents that the First Minister hoped would never get out. The SNP fought two votes in the Scottish Parliament to shut them down and waited until after Nicola Sturgeon’s evidence session to release it. “It’s beyond dispute that the government hid evidence from their own lawyers and then “discounted” their advice, as Roddy Dunlop QC put it. “These new documents show Nicola Sturgeon thought she was a better lawyer than Queen’s Counsel. She was emphatically wrong and it cost taxpayers more than £500,000. “The government was advised to concede a month before they did. Then they ran up an even bigger bill for weeks after they had been told the case was unstatable, the minimum requirement to proceed. “Their case was doomed from the start but they hid the evidence from their own lawyers, to the embarrassment and utter dismay of Roddy Dunlop QC. “The fact there are missing minutes from the meeting that Nicola Sturgeon herself attended confirms this is a cover up. Crucial evidence has been hidden. “The SNP thought Nicola Sturgeon had been exonerated by an evidence session where she failed to answer questions more than 100 times. “After the revelations of these latest documents, the First Minister’s position is more unstable than ever. This is a crushing blow to Nicola Sturgeon’s chances in the Vote of No Confidence.""",2150,2569,309,"https://www.facebook.com/136308776480/posts/10157798941386481"
