# Text Analysis with R

In this workshop, we will cover the basic assumptions behind computational text analysis, the pre-processing steps needed prior to the analysis, and various analytical techniques. We will also offer a brief overview of widely used methods in computational text analysis. If time allows, we will also cover sentiment analysis, a useful technique to identify the polarity of text documents.

## Topics
* Pre-processing
    * Removal of punctuation
    * Tokenization 
    * Stop-words 
* Text visualization and analysis
    * Word clouds, Word frequency
    * Word clouds, TF-IDF
* Sentiment analysis (if time allows)
