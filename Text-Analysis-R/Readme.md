# Text Analysis with R

In this workshop, we will cover the basic assumptions behind computational text analysis, the pre-processing steps needed prior to the analysis, and various analytical techniques. We will also offer a brief overview of widely used methods in computational text analysis. If time allows, we will also cover sentiment analysis, a useful technique to identify the polarity of text documents.
