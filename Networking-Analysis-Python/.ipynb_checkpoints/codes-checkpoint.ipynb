    "\n",
    "- **Degree centrality**: the number of connections (edges) to other users as the measure of importance\n",

    "\n",

    "    - \"Structural holes\": An individual who acts as a mediator between two or more closely connected groups of people could gain important comparative advantages. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Eigenvector centrality** measurement describes the centrality of a person with regard to the global structure of the network. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    - It assigns relative scores to all nodes in the network based on the concept that connections to nodes with high scoring contrib- ute more to the score of the node in question than connections to nodes with low scoring.\n",

    "    \n",
    "    - PageRank algorithm gives nontrivial results only for asymmetric networks. If links are symmetric (undirected), the PageRank values will be the same as node degrees.\n",
