# Network Analysis with R

In this workshop, we will cover the basic theory behind network analysis. In the practice section, we will show the main ways to read network data using R, basic exploration and visualisation of a network, and how to calculate several network metrics, including degree centrality, betweenness centrality, and pagerank. If time allowed, we will also cover community detection, a useful way to classify network nodes into different groups (known as community).
